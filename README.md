# Ted-Talk-Analyser

Ted talks are becoming more and more popular with increasing number of topics and videos.
Built a model which analyses huge dataset and finds what makes a talk more popular than the other.
Fetched the dataset from Kaggle, Twitter API.
Plotted graphs for talks based on various deciding attributes.
Future talks can be predicted if they would receive a positive or a negative feedback based on the implementation of
k nearest neighbours algorithm.
